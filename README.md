I'm a student at KTH, intrested in both hardware and software. Some of the projects I have made/been a part of are designing a tiny ESP32 board(Atom), SMS notification system(SMSNotify) and a remote controlled relay(remote_door_lock).
- The Atom project is a ongoaing project to design a PCB for a small and efficent multipurpose microcontroller.
- SMSNotify is a small project for sending SMS with a custom message if a pin is pulled down. The code is made for a TTGO T-Call v1.4 which uses the SIM800H for Cellular connection.
- remote_door_lock was my gymnasium degree project. My section of the project was to create the api and database for keeping track of admins, users and a log of usage.
